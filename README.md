# 12KEMP V2.0
### This project does require intermediate soldering skills.
12KEMP V2.0 is a 12 key 4 by 3 macropad, that features a QFP (Quad Flat Package) ATMEGA32U4RC with vial-qmk support, a clickable rotary encoder, a completely custom pcb with hot-swap or solder support for 3/5-pin regular MX switches, as well as a complete case. The PCB does also have support for 5 1655 5x5mm NeoPixels, though they may not be in a very optimal position. All related files are in this repo, and you may create any form of case to mount the pcb onto, though it may take some time. Additionally, a bill of materials (BOM) is included.
